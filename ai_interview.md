Here is the job listing \<snip\>. You will roleplay the interviewer and give question, then I will answer them, and then you will me if I answered well.
  
**Assistant**
Sure! Here are some questions to get started:

1. Can you describe your previous experience with testing systems and creating test plans and scripts?
2. How do you approach integration, regression, and functional testing in your work?
3. Have you worked with platforms like Pega or Dynamics before? If so, how did you use them in your testing processes?
4. How do you ensure compliance with system requirements and business practices and policies during your testing processes?
5. Have you ever worked on a multiyear contract before? If so, how did you approach the long-term nature of the work?
  
**Pia**  
At Discovery I was the main User Acceptance Tester for Discovery's XML generator. These XMLs were required to distribute digital media content to 
companies like Apple, Google and Amazon. As a tester I had to go over each line of XML and look for errors. Then I had to run tests where the XMLs 
were paired with various media files and sent to the aggregators.
 
**Assistant**  
That sounds like a valuable experience in testing systems and creating test plans and scripts. Can you tell me more about your approach to integration,
regression, and functional testing?
 
**Pia**
I performed integration testing when new information was added to Discovery's media content management system and I had to ensure the information was 
automatically updated to the XML generator. For regression testing, each time a company required new information added to the XMLs my team of software developers had to update the XML generator which meant new code. When the new version of XML generator is released I then performed regression testing to ensure no new errors appear due to new code changes.

**Assistant**
Thank you for the information. It sounds like you have experience in both integration testing and regression testing. How do you approach functional testing in your work?

**Pia**
When it comes to functional testing I base my tests off the requirements demanded by the companies who stream Discovery's media content. Each company Discovery works with has their own separate set of requirements. For example, Amazon requires certain media to be streamed in HD format, so the XMLs must contain a field for HD format. Each time I create an XML using the XML generator, I click on the HD field to ensure the XML contains HD. If the XML does not contain the HD then it causes problems for Amazon when Amazon's viewers cannot locate HD content. During the testing phase I create a test script to help me check that all Amazon's requirements are met.
  
**Assistant**
Thank you for the detailed explanation. It sounds like you have a thorough understanding of functional testing and how it relates to the specific requirements of different companies. Do you have any experience with platforms like \<snip\> or \<snip\>?

**Pia**
I don't have any experience with \<snip\> or \<snip\> but I'd be willing to learn if the company trains me on them.

**Assistant**
That's a good answer. It's always valuable to be open to learning new tools and technologies, especially in the field of testing where new platforms and software are constantly being developed. Do you have any questions about the job or the company before we wrap up this interview?

**Pia**
Do you have any more questions for me as a manual tester who is new to testing?

**Assistant**
Here are a few more questions:

1. Have you worked on a team of testers before? If so, how did you communicate and coordinate with your team members to ensure effective testing?
1. Can you describe a situation in which you encountered a difficult problem during testing, and how you approached and solved it?
1. How do you keep up to date with industry best practices and trends in testing?
1. Do you have any experience with automated testing? If so, what tools and techniques have you used?

**Pia**
I have a story in which I encountered a difficult problem during testing. One of Discovery's aggregators, TVN, required updates to the XMLs. Our development team created a new version of the XML generator which I tested and found no issues. The problem arose when we paired the XML with the media files and sent them through the Encoding Packager. The Encoding Packager then sends the files to the aggregators where the media content is made available for streaming to customers. However, the files wouldn't go through the Encode Packager due to file errors. As tester I had to double-check the XMLs for errors by reviewing each line of XML and found a small an extra tag in the XML which I failed to notice in my first test. Since the developers already released the latest version of the XML generator I had to wait until the next release to fix this issue. In the meantime, every XML that went to TVN had to be manually edited by me in order to successfully send to TVN. I worked with the Development team to fix this issue on the next release.

**Assistant**
That's a good example of a problem you encountered during testing and how you approached and solved it. It's important to be thorough and detail-oriented in testing, as small issues like the one you encountered can have significant impacts on the final product. Do you have any experience working on a team of testers, or coordinating with other team members during the testing process?

**Pia**
I have not worked with a team of testers, but each month I did have to work very closely with Discovery's Development team who created the XML generator and were responsible for releasing new versions every month for new company requirements. During the testing process I had to coordinate with other team members like Discovery's scheduling team to ensure I had the correct dates which are embedded in the XMLs and can cause problems if incorrect. The scheduling team are also responsible for inputting media information into Discovery's content management system which connects to the XML generator. Each time the scheduling team makes updates it affects the XML generator and I have to test each update.

**Assistant**
It sounds like you have experience coordinating with other team members and departments during the testing process. Communication and coordination are important skills for any tester to have, as testing often involves working with a variety of people and systems. Do you have any experience with automated testing, or with keeping up to date with industry best practices and trends in testing?

**Pia**
I do not have any experience with automated testing or coding, but I think with my experience I would be great in manual testing. I understand the life cycle of software development, like meeting with clients to to understand their requirements, testing for bugs which can have significant impact on the end users, and ultimately releasing the software. Even after release there are always new updates that need further testing.

**Assistant**
Manual testing is a valuable skill, and your understanding of the software development life cycle and the importance of testing is important for any tester to have. While automated testing can be a useful tool, it's important for testers to also have a strong foundation in manual testing techniques and processes. Do you have any other questions about the job or the company before we wrap up this interview?

**Pia**
No, hopefully someone will hire me as an entry level manual tester.

**Assistant**
I'm sure you'll make a great addition to any team as a manual tester. Don't forget to emphasize your understanding of the software development life cycle and the importance of thorough testing in your interviews. Good luck with your job search!
